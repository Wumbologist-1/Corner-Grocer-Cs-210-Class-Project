Corner Grocer Item Tracker - Portfolio Reflection
Luis Tomassini
Project Summary
The Corner Grocer Item Tracker is a C++ program that analyzes grocery item purchases by reading a text-based data file. It processes the list of purchased items and provides insights into how frequently each item was bought. The program allows users to:

Search for an item and view its purchase count.
Display all item frequencies in a structured format.
Generate a histogram for a visual representation of item popularity.
Backup frequency data to a file (frequency.dat) for future reference.
This project was developed to help businesses track purchase patterns and optimize inventory management.

Key Accomplishments
One of the aspects I did particularly well was implementing structured file handling and data processing. Using maps (std::map), I efficiently stored item frequencies, which allowed quick lookup and data retrieval. The menu-driven interface also provides a user-friendly experience, allowing seamless interaction with the system.

Code Enhancement Opportunities
There are a few areas where the code could be further optimized:

Case-Insensitive Search: Currently, searches are case-sensitive, meaning "apples" and "Apples" are treated differently. Implementing case normalization would improve accuracy.
Improved Data Validation: Additional validation checks can be added to prevent invalid or empty inputs.
Histogram Formatting: Enhancing the visual representation of the histogram, such as aligning item names with dynamic spacing, would improve readability.
These improvements would make the program more efficient, user-friendly, and adaptable.

Challenges and How I Overcame Them
The most challenging aspect was handling file I/O operations robustly, ensuring that missing or unreadable files didn't crash the program. To address this, I implemented error handling mechanisms using condition checks and user notifications. Additionally, implementing data persistence required structuring the frequency file format to ensure readability and maintainability.

Transferable Skills
This project strengthened my skills in:

File handling and data persistence in C++.
Efficient data structures (std::map) for fast lookups.
Error handling and validation to prevent crashes.
Building modular and readable code for better maintainability.
These skills will be useful in future software development projects, especially those involving data analysis, backend development, and system automation.

Maintaining Readability & Adaptability
To ensure the project remains maintainable and scalable, I followed these best practices:

Used consistent naming conventions for variables and functions.
Structured the code into separate functions for different functionalities (searching, displaying, and writing to files).
Included inline comments to describe key logic, making it easier for future developers to understand.
By structuring the project well, it can be easily adapted to track different types of sales data or integrated with a larger inventory management system.
